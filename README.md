# rootsAndroidApp
Roots was created for study purposes.

Originally it was made for the 'Call For Code' hackathon, but it was a PWA project, you can check it here: https://github.com/roots-ibm/roots

Since I'm studying mobile applications I'm re-programming it to apply everything I've learned in class.
